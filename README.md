# Ramani UX Portfolio
Hi! My name is Sri Ramani Thungapati. I like to be called Ramani. I'm a Computer Science major, passionate about web and mobile development, constantly expanding my skills to build impactful and user-friendly applications. My career goal is to secure a role where I can contribute to innovative tech solutions and enhance my expertise in front-end and back-end development.
Outside of coding, I enjoy playing badminton and spending time outdoors. Whether it's a competitive match or just unwinding in nature, I love staying active and finding balance beyond the screen.

I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges in both my personal and professional life.
